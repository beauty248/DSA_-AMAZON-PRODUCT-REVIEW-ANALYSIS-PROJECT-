## 📦 DSA Amazon Product Review Analysis Project
This project marks the beginning of my data analytics portfolio. I worked on it during my Data Analysis class with **The Incubator Hub,** where we explored real-world datasets using Excel.

Over the past two weeks, this project has helped me **build confidence in my ability to ask analytical questions, clean data, identify trends, and derive insights that can support decision-making.**

## 🔍 What This Project Is About

I looked at data from **1,351 Amazon products**. My goal was to understand:

* How much discount people get on products
* What kind of products are being sold
* How customers are reacting (through reviews and ratings)
* Which products are doing the best
* If giving discounts helps improve customer satisfaction

## 📊 What I Found

### 💸 Prices & Discounts

* On average, Amazon gives a **47% discount** on products, that’s almost half off!
* The **original price** of most products was around ₹5,691, but after discounts, it dropped to ₹3,305.
* **608 products (about 45%)** had discounts of **50% or more**  a big deal for customers looking for bargains.
* The **Computers & Accessories** category had the biggest discounts, up to **94% off**. This may be to clear out old stock or attract more buyers.

### 🛍️ Product Types & Prices

* Most products were priced **above ₹500**, showing Amazon sells a lot of mid- to high-priced items.
* Price breakdown:

  * 870 products were **above ₹500**
  * 342 were **between ₹200–₹500**
  * 159 were **below ₹200**

### 💬 Customer Reviews & Ratings

* The data included a total of **23.8 million reviews**
* 308 products had **less than 1,000 reviews**, maybe they’re new or not popular yet.
* Some products had as many as **3.6 million reviews**!
* The **top 3 products with perfect 5-star ratings** were:

  1. BO9ZKCJDP1
  2. BOBP7XLX48
  3. BOBQRJ3B47

### 🌟 Best-Performing Products

The **top 5 products** with both **high ratings** and **lots of reviews** were:

1. BO7KSMBL24
2. BO1418SSDO
3. BO1418SX4Y
4. BO9GQ4K6L
5. BO7GPXXNNG

These are clearly customer favorites.

### 🧾 Discounts vs. Ratings

* I found that products with big discounts also had an **average rating of 4.1 stars**.
* This suggests that **lower prices can make customers happier** (or at least feel like they got a good deal).

## 🧼 How I Cleaned the Data

Before analyzing, I had to **clean the data** so it made sense. Here’s what I did:

1. **Looked through the data** to understand what was inside.
2. **Removed extra or unnecessary info** that wasn’t useful.
3. **Deleted any repeated (duplicate) data**.
4. Created new tables to help me answer important questions:

   * Which products had 50%+ discounts?
   * How much money could be made from all the products?
   * How are products priced (cheap, mid, expensive)?
   * Which products had less than 1,000 reviews?
   * Which products were top-rated?

These steps helped me understand the data and find clear answers.
