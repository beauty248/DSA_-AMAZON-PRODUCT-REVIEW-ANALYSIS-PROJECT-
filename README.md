# DATA CLEANING PROCESS:
The cleaning of my Amazon Project Review Analysis started with this breakdown steps,
Firstly, i study the data file after which i removed all unnecessary data that are not needed on the data file.
Scondly, i removed all dulicated data on the sheet. 
I started creating the necessary tables by answering the quesions: table such as 50% or more, Total potential revenue, Price range bucket, Fewer than 1000, %Discount grouping and Top 5 rating.
With this new created table i was able to solve the questions.
